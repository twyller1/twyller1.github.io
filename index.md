### CPSC 120


*[Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-twyller-and-jocsan/tree/main/part-2)


   Lab 4, part 2 is a favorite of mine because we were able to code a game that involved more than one person. One person picks a secret number while the other player has to guess what the secret number is.


*[Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-ryan-Twyller-Miguel/tree/main/part-2)


   Lab 6, part 2 is also one of my favorite labs we completed because we created a program that allows the computer to calculate the average of a group of numbers. In class, we learned that computers cannot just automatically do calculations, so it was interesting to give the computer the ability to do so.


*[Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-rudy-twyller/tree/main/part-1)


   Lab 7,  part  1 is one of my favorite labs because I enjoyed creating the Hi-Lo game. I thought it was interesting to be able to create a simple game like this one where the user is able to play and interact with the computer. The user has to guess the secret number chosen by the computer.
